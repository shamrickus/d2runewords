# d2runewords

Maintains a list of runewords parsed from arreat summit that you can search over.

# Dev Depencies

The scraper runs off of python2 and requires https://docs.python.org/2/library/htmlparser.html
The actual web page runs off of bootstrap, bootstrap material, jquery, and angular

## Testing

Testing requries npm, the actual site does not use the npm repos since I am no a big fan of npm. To get tests running after npm is installed run npm install. After that has completed you can run karma start to run the tests.
